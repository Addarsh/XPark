A Low cost Wireless Sensor Network for Automated Parking

# Description
Finding parking spots on the go is incredibly hard in most major cities. Drivers usually have to arbitrarily
circle around quite a bit before they can find parking. The knowledge of free parking spots in real time
can be not only be a great time saver but also greatly reduce stress associated with parking among users. 

The goal of this project is to utilize low cost sensors to demostrate an automated web-based solution to parking.
